# LibraryManager Created By Kody McNamara
This is my final project for CS3330. It is a library management system.
It contains the features to add and remove products from a catalog of products, to check out and return products, and various search functions.

It uses a factory design pattern to create products and a Map to correlate a user with their checked out products.
